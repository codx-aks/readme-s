## Decentralized Data Ownership and Monetization Platform (DApp) :

- -> Developed a DApp utilizing **IPFS** and **blockchain technology** to offer secure, private storage for ideas, knowledge, and sensitive data.
- -> Enables users to store data publicly on IPFS while keeping it private, accessible only via the owner's private key through blockchain-based encryption.
- -> Supports a **marketplace model** where users can **monetize** their encrypted data, as well as a **subscription-based service** for delivering real-time data (e.g., stock market insights).
- -> Allows users to **grant, revoke, and manage access** to their data with transparency and immutability provided by blockchain smart contracts.

## Secure ML Training with Data Ownership :

- -> Addresses the need for **dataset ownership in ML training and testing**, providing a privacy-preserving solution.
- -> Third parties submit their ML logic/files to an off-chain server running in a **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**, ensuring data confidentiality even at the hardware level.
- -> Encrypted datasets are fetched via smart contracts from IPFS, and the model is trained securely within the TEE.
- -> After training, the **model file (e.g., .pkl)** and insights are sent to the third party, while the data owner receives **crypto incentives** for data usage.
