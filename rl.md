## Reinforcement Learning for First-Person Shooter Environments 

- Implemented a reinforcement learning model using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** and **curriculum learning** tailored for FPS environments.
- Utilized the **Gym API** to create custom training scenarios, enhancing the adaptability of the model.
- Optimized visual input processing and streamlined training algorithms, achieving a 20% reduction in overall processing time.
